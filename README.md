# Data Related Job Postings Analysis
Data availability and its demonstrable value have created demand amongst employers for individuals with the necessary skills and experience. Our objective is to utilize the job descriptions of job postings for three commonly sought-after positions in data analytics in order to extract insights in their similarities and differences.
